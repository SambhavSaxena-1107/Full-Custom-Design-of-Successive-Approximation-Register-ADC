# Full-Custom-Design-of-Successive-Approximation-Register-ADC

This repository contains the full-custom design and simulation of a Successive Approximation Register (SAR) Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) using Cadence Virtuoso. The project is aimed at developing an ultra-low power, high-performance SAR ADC suitable for modern applications such as portable medical devices, IoT sensors, and industrial automation systems.

**Tools & Technologies:**

`Cadence Virtuoso:` Used for circuit design, symbol creation and simulation.

`90nm CMOS Technology:` The project uses a 90nm process for design and simulation.


**Problem Statement:**

Modern applications require ADCs that combine high resolution, low power consumption and compact design. Standard off-the-shelf ADCs often fail to meet these demands due to limitations in speed, power efficiency or integration capabilities. This project addresses the growing need for custom-designed ADCs that can deliver optimized performance for critical applications like medical devices and battery-operated systems.
